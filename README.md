## Common errors

- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index name.
- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in the `pinecone.ts` and `.env` files.
- Check that you've set the vector dimensions to `1536`.
- Make sure your pinecone namespace is in lowercase.
