**General errors**

- Make sure you're running the latest Node version. Run `node -v`
- Try a different PDF or convert your PDF to text first. It's possible your PDF is corrupted, scanned, or requires OCR to convert to text.
- `Console.log` the `env` variables and make sure they are exposed.
- Make sure you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repo.
- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index name.
- If you change `modelName` in `OpenAI`, make sure you have access to the api for the appropriate model.
- Make sure you have enough OpenAI credits and a valid card on your billings account.
- Check that you don't have multiple OPENAPI keys in your global environment. If you do, the local `env` file from the project will be overwritten by systems `env` variable.
- Try to hard code your API keys into the `process.env` variables if there are still issues.

**Pinecone errors**

- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in the `pinecone.ts` and `.env` files.
- Check that you've set the vector dimensions to `1536`.
